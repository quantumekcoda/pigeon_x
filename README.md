THE PIGEON GENETIC ALGORITHM AI 


  TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE PIGEON GENETIC ALGORITHM AI 
This is the most advanced pigeon-based AI ever (because no one else was unhinged enough to attempt it). A genetic algorithm-powered, deep-learning-infused, XGBoost-enhanced monstrosity built to optimize squawks, dominate breadcrumbs, and outmaneuver rival flocks.

 Core Pigeon Technologies at Play:
XGBoost Pigeon → A boosted decision model that predicts the likelihood of a pigeon squawking at crumbs based on peck rate, wing flap intensity, and overall urban chaos levels.
Pigeon Deep Net → A neural network trained NOT with boring backpropagation, but with a brutal, nature-inspired genetic algorithm where only the most elite pigeons survive.
Custom Pigeon Loss Function → Because regular loss functions weren’t chaotic enough, this one punishes pigeons who don't squawk loud enough with an artificial "coo penalty."
Pigeon Genetic Algorithm → Instead of adjusting weights like a normal person, we evolve our pigeons using mutation, crossover, and a survival-of-the-loudest mechanism. The fittest pigeons pass on their knowledge of optimal squawk timing to the next generation.
Welcome to Pigeon Singularity—the algorithm that ensures pigeons will outcompute, outflap, and outcoo humanity.


 Why We Did This
Because regular AI wasn’t chaotic enough. i wanted to build something that pushes the limits of machine learning while making absolutely zero sense—and somehow, it worked. Pegion AI is proof that with enough over-engineering and caffeine, anything can become an AI problem.
